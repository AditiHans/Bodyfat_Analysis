# Bodyfat_Analysis
🧠 Project Overview

The Body Fat Analysis System is a data-driven predictive model designed to estimate body fat percentage using anthropometric and physiological measurements.
By combining regression modeling, dimensionality reduction, and clustering, the project demonstrates how statistical and machine learning techniques can uncover relationships between body metrics and composition patterns.

🎯 Objectives

Predict body fat percentage using multiple physiological attributes.

Identify key influencing factors among body measurements.

Cluster individuals into meaningful body composition groups for comparative analysis.
